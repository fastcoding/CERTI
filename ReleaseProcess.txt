This file tries to describe the current CERTI release process.
Current version is written for a CERTI administrator 
and may certainly be only readable for them.

CERTI releases should be done with the following steps:

1) Announce release freeze on certi-devel
   and check for no-go message

2) Review currently opened and fixed bug/task in the tracker

    Bugs:
    https://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/?group=certi
    - checked if fixed are really CVS and switches
       status from ReadyToTest to Done
                   from Open to Closed
                   check the Release 

    Tasks:
    https://savannah.nongnu.org/task/?group=certi
    - checked Done or ReadyToTest tasks
      close them and fix the Release.

3) Edit certi/CMakeLists.txt
   and bump the version to the right number with
   [example for certi-3.2.5]

   SET(PACKAGE_VERSION_MAJOR "3")
   SET(PACKAGE_VERSION_MINOR "2")
   SET(PACKAGE_VERSION_PATCH "5")

4) commit the modified files
   certi/CMakeLists.txt
   with a meaningful comment saying you are preparing a CERTI version

5) Do a fresh checkout somewhere
   Build certi from your pristine source tree

     Better is at least 2 built:
         Linux ix86 wth gcc  (32bits)
         Windows win32 with Visual Studio 
                     and/or Code::Blocks (http://www.codeblocks.org/)
                     and/or Wascana (http://wascana.sourceforge.net/)                     

6) Run autotests :))
   Which means for today run as many tests as you can do
      - billard
      - HLA Tutorial 
      - HLA TestsSuite
   All those tests do have an associated dtest scripts. 
   see for example certi/tests/Billard/dtest_billard.py
   or HLA_TestsSuite/dtest_*.py    

7) Tag certi tree with appropriate version

   cvs tag CERTI-3_2_5 certi

   Generate the Changelog file using certi/scripts/cvs2cl.pl

   For example updating Changelog for CERTI 3.2.4 to 3.2.5 will be done
   using the following command:

   cd /path/to/certi
   scripts/cvs2cl.pl -t -r --delta CERTI-3_2_4:CERTI-3_2_5 --prune -T --accum 

   commit the ChangeLog file
   force the tag on it:
   cvs tag -F CERTI-3_2_5 certi/ChangeLog

8) Make certi packages using cpack
     - tar.gz (sources)              [mandatory]
     - RPM (sources and binaries)    [optional]
     - Win32 NSIS binary installer   [recommended]

9) Tests your packages or ask for help to test them
   on certi-devel
   Fix packaging trouble if any and move the previous tag 
   if any commit occured.

10) Digitally sign the packages you made and put them
    in the download area:
    https://savannah.gnu.org/maintenance/DownloadArea

    gpg -b certi-3.2.5.tar.gz

11) Check if the download area has been properly updated
    http://download.savannah.nongnu.org/releases/certi/
     
    Beware the automatic mirror selection, go to 
    the "noredirect" link: 
    http://download.savannah.gnu.org/releases-noredirect/certi/
     
    Or look at the mirror monitoring:
    http://download.savannah.gnu.org/mirmon/

12) Post the appropriate news on Savannah CERTI pages
    https://savannah.nongnu.org/news/submit.php?group=certi

    DON'T MAIL to certi-devel since news are 
    automagically forwarded to appropriate ML

    Remember that once you have posted the news you should
    approve it before it appears on first page.
    
13) OPTIONNALLY update online CERTI documentation at 
        http://www.nongnu.org/certi

You are right this process IS painful and should be automated (a lot...)
be sure we are working on it :))
